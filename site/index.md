# DINO SIP Python workshop materials

**SEE MY NOTES IN INKDROP!**

- Goals of this workshop
  - Exposure to Python specifically, and programming and open source software more generally
- What is Python
- Some comparisons/contrasts to Matlab (since they were already introduced)
- Installation. Choices about Python itself and GUI's, development environment
  - Unlike Matlab or proprietary software, there are multiple choices (as is common in open source software)!
  - Python: installation from python.org and other sources; conda (which itself has several options)
  - Can execute from the terminal or a very simple "IDE" (IDLE) when installed from 
  - JupyterLab, Spyder (most like Matlab), VSCode, Thonny (for learning!), PyCharm (free for education use; for heavy duty dev)
  - We will use Anaconda conda distribution for convenience (easy installation, easy launching of JupyterLab and Spyder) (**BUT I NEED TO TEST IT MYSELF!**). 
  - Will code mainly in Jupyter notebooks, but will briefly show running Python code in Spyder and Thonny (Thonny for follow-up, painless learning)
  - also can use online Python tools
- The lessons
- Let's try to open and visualize the CTD data from your cruises! (note:install folium, cartopy, or holoviz)
- Q&A's

In good open source fashion, I've drawn most of the content from existing open tutorials and resources.

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a free, open-source, general-purpose and high-level programming language. It's relatively easy to learn, and the syntax facilitates writing new code fairly quickly. In the last few years it has become one of the most widely used general programming languages (see [here](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and [here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)) and also among the [most popular language for data science applications](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/). It's also widely used in the scientific community in general, and in Oceanography specifically (see [here](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/why-python.html) and [here](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00037)).

**More things to say about Python:** multi OS/platform; often used in introductory classes, esp. for non CS majors.

## Installation

installing the language vs the tools (software) used to develop and run code efficiently

## Lessons

- [Quick, live overview](./overview.md). We'll run quickly through many of the core features of the language, using a Jupyter notebook in a live session online.
- [Detailed lessons](./lessons.md)
- [Advanced examples](./advancedexamples.md)

Plus [Python cheat sheets.](./cheatsheets.md)
