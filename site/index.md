Goals of this workshop

In good open source fashion, I've drawn most of the content from existing open tutorials and resources.

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a free, open-source, general-purpose and high-level programming language. It's relatively easy to learn, and the syntax facilitates writing new code fairly quickly. In the last few years it has become one of the most widely used general programming languages (see [here](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and [here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)) and also among the [most popular language for data science applications](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/). It's also widely used in the scientific community in general, and in Oceanography specifically (see [here](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/why-python.html) and [here](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00037)).


## Installation

installing the language vs the tools (software) used to develop and run code efficiently

## Lessons

- [Quick, live overview](./overview.md). We'll run quickly through many of the core features of the language, using a Jupyter notebook in a live session online.
- [Detailed lessons](./lessons.md)
- [Advanced examples](./advancedexamples.md)

Plus [cheat sheets.](./cheatsheets.md)
