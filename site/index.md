# DINO SIP Python workshop materials

## Goals

1. Provide exposure to the Python programming language and "ecosystem" specifically, and programming and open-source software more generally.
2. Provide a ramp for future, self-guided learning to both strengthen core topics that were covered and explore new topics.

With open-source software, we build on the work of others, contribute back to it, and build something new on top in collaboration with others. Rather than creating learning materials from scratch, here we'll rely on existing, open community resources. We can correct, polish and extend these materials with your input!

This workshop is intended as a 3-hour workshop, but the source materials in full provide a longer, more comprehensive experience.

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a free, open-source, general-purpose and high-level programming language. It's relatively easy to learn, and the syntax facilitates writing new code fairly quickly. In the last few years it has become one of the most widely used general programming languages (see [here](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and [here](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)) and also among the [most popular language for data science applications](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/). It's also widely used in the scientific community in general, and in Oceanography specifically (see [here](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/why-python.html) and [here](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00037)).

**More things to say about Python:** multi OS/platform; often used in introductory classes, esp. for non CS majors.

- Have a brief intro about open source software
  - freedom, openness, access, community orientation
  - but it can be confusing
    - often multiple different ways to do the same thing; eg, install Python, code development (different IDE's, etc)
    - compare to the simplicity of installing Matlab (which they will have seen already)

## Installation

[Installing Python and software to develop and execute](./install-run.md)

installing the language vs the tools (software) used to develop and run code efficiently

## Lessons

- [Quick, live overview](./overview.md). We'll run quickly through many of the core features of the language, using a Jupyter notebook in a live session online.
- [Detailed lessons](./lessons.md)
- [Advanced examples](./advancedexamples.md). We'll use a Python package to open and explore CTD data, including the data you collected last week!

Plus [Python cheat sheets.](./cheatsheets.md)
