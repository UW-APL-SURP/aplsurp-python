# Quick Python overview

At the same time as the lessons, we recommend this quick overview of basic Python features that also covers general programming themes. The overview also presents, briefly, a few more advanced capabilities that are widely used with scientific and engineering data.

Go to [Quickstart: Zero to Python â€” Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/quickstart.html). There, click on the "Launch kernel" icon ![Pythia launch kernel](img/Pythia-launch-kernel.png) below the page title, to the right, to run the steps live, online! It will launch a `Jupyter` notebook on `JupyterLab`, online. This open-source overview will serve also as an initial exposure to `JupyterLab` and `Jupyter` notebooks. It is provided by [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org).

[https://learnpython.org](https://learnpython.org) can nicely complement the Project Pythia Quickstart. It is a compact introduction featuring online interactive coding, organized by Python feature.
