# Quick Python overview

Let's do a quick overview of basic Python features, which more broadly will also cover general programming themes. This overview will also cover, briefly, a few more advanced capabilities that are widely used with scientific and engineering data.

Go to [Quickstart: Zero to Python â€” Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/quickstart.html). There, we will all click on the "Binder" link at the top (the rocket icon) to run the steps live, online! It will launch a Jupyter notebook on JupyterLab, online. So, this will serve also as an initial exposure to JupyterLab and Jupyter notebooks. This open-source overview is provided by [Project Pythia, https://projectpythia.org](https://projectpythia.org).

[https://learnpython.org](https://learnpython.org) can nicely complement the Project Pythia Quickstart. It is a nice and compact introduction featuring online interactive coding, organized by Python feature.
