# Complementary, in-depth lessons from other groups

There are **many** free Python tutorials online; a quick search will produce a very long list. For example, [Python Basics: Introduction to Python](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python-basics/) features many detailed lessons from [https://realpython.com](https://realpython.com), which are a great source for Python in-depth learning. [Project Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) has a great collection of more advanced tutorials especially geared for the earth sciences, including Oceanography.

The [lessons we created for the APL SURP course](lessons/index) cover each topic relatively briefly. Rather than creating new, in-depth learning materials from scratch, we'll take advantage of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), "a global community teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers in academia, industry and government." Carpentries tutorials and lessons are openly accessible.

Specifically, **we'll focus on the [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lesson from The Carpentries**: "This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous programming experience." It's also referred to as the "gapminder" lesson, based on the dataset it uses.

```{note}
Another, similar Carpentries lesson that you may find helpful is [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/): "The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis."
```

## Getting the Data

The data used in this subset of Software Carpentry lessons is taken from the [gapminder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapminder_Foundation) dataset. To obtain it, download and unzip the file [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip). To execute the lesson materials, launch JupyterLab in the folder that contains the unzipped data file. (see [Starting JupyterLab](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/01-run-quit.html#starting-jupyterlab)).

## Lesson episodes

The *Plotting and Programming in Python* lesson is intended as a workshop that takes a full day. The *subset* of materials (referred to as "episodes") presented here expands on the lessons presented directly in the APL SURP course.
