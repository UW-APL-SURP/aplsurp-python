# Quick start / overview

Go to the lesson, and let's all click on the binder link to go through it online?! It will also serve as an exposure to Jupyter notebooks!

[Quickstart: Zero to Python â€” Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/quickstart.html)


I put a copy of that lesson (which is a Jupyter notebook) here: [notebooks/projectpythia-quickstart.ipynb](./notebooks/projectpythia-quickstart.ipynb).
