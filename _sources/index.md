# APL SURP Python Course

A compressed introduction to Python for participants in the [APL SURP (Summer Undergraduate Research) Program](https://www.apl.uw.edu/education/dino_sip.php) at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory.

## Goals

1. Provide *exposure* to the Python programming language and "ecosystem" specifically, and programming and open-source software more generally.
2. Provide a ramp for future, self-guided learning to both strengthen core topics that were covered and explore new topics.

With open-source software, we build on the work of others, contribute back to it, and build something new on top in collaboration with others. Rather than creating learning materials from scratch, here we'll rely on existing, open community resources. We can correct, polish and extend these materials with your input!

This workshop is intended as a 3-hour workshop, but the source materials provide a longer, more comprehensive experience.

## Installation and execution

[A brief overview](./install-run.md) of options for installing Python and developing and executing Python code. It points to specific instructions for installing the Anaconda distribution and the JupyterLab user interface, which we will use.

## Lessons

- HERE LIST PRIMARILY ETHAN'S NOTEBOOKS
- BUT ADD A SECTION FOR MY OTHER MATERIALS (SEPARATED INTO CORE PYTHON VS MY ADVANCED EXAMPLES)
- Also weave the individual lessons (from Carpentry & Pythia) into the notebooks, or as additional notes here next to each notebook

- [Quick, live overview](./overview.md). We'll run quickly through many of the core features of the language, using a Jupyter notebook in a live session online.
- [Detailed lessons](./lessons.md)
- [Advanced examples](./advancedexamples.md). We'll use a Python package to open and explore CTD data, including the data you collected last week!

Plus [Python cheat sheets.](./cheatsheets.md)
